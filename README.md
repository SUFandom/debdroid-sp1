# Debdroid

**Service Pack 1**

This script adds additional Utilities to Debdroid, it is optional to be installed on the OS

- The Additional Utilities are:
  
  - Package Upgrade
      - diagnose
      - identify
      - **NEW!!** Git Manager


Again this is optional to be installed and you can add them if you want

## Wait... a Service Pack?

Yes because this is just a sort-of 'unimportant' utility to some but actually this is also a fix for some people who struggle using this OS

## Requirements

- Installed Debdroid with finished installation of Debdroid-starter

## Start

exec here:

```
chmod +x *.sh && ./init.sh 
```

requires to be run on debdroid
